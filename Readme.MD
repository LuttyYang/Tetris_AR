## Features: 
### From Kaielth
 - Simple tetris concept, all tetrominoes falling to bottom, when a row is full then it dissapear and the above rows falls down.
 - Queue for N elements, implemented for up to 3 next pieces
 - Score based on the amount of rows removed at the same time. Points added calculated as N * N, where N is number of rows removed.
 - Speed of the pieces falling increased after certain amount of pieces generated. Speed increased at piece 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250.
