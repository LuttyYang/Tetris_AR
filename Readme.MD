Designed and Developed by Tim, original version *Tetris_Remake* is folked from tomgsx.

Features: (Kaielth's Folk)
 - Simple tetris concept, all tetrominoes falling to bottom, when a row is full then it dissapear and the above rows falls down.
 - Queue for N elements, implemented for up to 3 next pieces
 - Score based on the amount of rows removed at the same time. Points added calculated as N * N, where N is number of rows removed.
 - Speed of the pieces falling increased after certain amount of pieces generated. Speed increased at piece 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250.

## AR Changes
- platform is vuforia
- use virtual button to control the game

## How To Use
- print the [imgae target](https://geekgame.bai.uno/geekgame.jpg) or download it to your pad
- apply a vuforia key
- past the key to "App License Key" in ARCamera
- run   ^_^

## Problems
1. *** very important, need another better image target, (already get one, but withou printer, can not print it) to make the buttons more sensitive
2. add audio
